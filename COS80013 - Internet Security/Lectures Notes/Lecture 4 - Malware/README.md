## Terminology 

- **Malware**

Malware is a general term that describes a set of things that can infect your computer. The categories that malware can fall into depends on what its intended purpose is.

- **Virus**

A virus is called a virus because of how it mimics real life viruses and how it is spreads. It usually requires some form of human interaction to spread, such as installing infect software and clicking on dodgy websites.

Viruses generally spread by coping themselves onto the hard drives of the infect computers.

- **Worms**

Unlike viruses, worms do not infect hard drives. The purpose of a worm is for it to seek out network ports to tunnel through. A way to protect from worm attacks is to implement a firewall.

Worms will generally try to spread by finding vulnerabilities from the host network and do not require human interaction to spread.

- **Trojan**

A trojan is a type of malware that looks likes a normal program but has a mallicious payload installed with it. When the software is installed, the trojan will unpack itself and take over the infected computer. Trojans can sometimes disable certain security measures allowing it to silently install programs such as key loggers, screen capture software and to mainly take over it.

- **Root Kit**

A root kit is a technology used to install malware on a computer. It patches the OS kernal and overrides programs and processes like task manager and explorer so infected files cannot be found and process not listed. Doing this helps hide the malware from users and also anti-virus programs that would want to remove them.

- **Adware**

A type of malware that installs software on your computer that opens up a TCP or UDP port to send information back to its originator. It can send key strokes, password information and can also download targeted ads to the user browser or computer.

- **Spyware**

A type of malware that can be used to monitor what you are doing. Not always used by mallicious people since companies like Microsoft and LinkedIn in the past have been caught using it to monitor user activity and using their data for their own purposes. Very fine line between the ethical usage of spyware.

- **Browser Hijacking**

A form of spyware that affects the browser. Can be seen as an additional bar installed into the browser that displays ads and can also redirect a users desired web address to another webpage that may be advertising or to install other bits of malware. 

Hard for anti-virus programs to detect as it uses a white listed port to conduct its activity.

- **Bots and BotNet**

Type of malware that allows an AI or remote party to take control of a computer. By taking over, anything can be done such as stealing documents, changing access priveledges and opening ports allowing back door entry.

A bot usually manifests itself as a command line IRC client like a terminal session.

- **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**

A trojan that takes the form of remote desktop access allowing the hacker to see what you are doing in real time on screen. 

- **Sandboxing**

Restricting the level of access to a computer through sandboxing is usually a good method to prevent malware from spreading. A good test environment.
