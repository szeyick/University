### Malware

A virus is called as such because it mimics how viruses in real life spread, with the need of humans. A virus generally spreads by copying itself through the computers hard drives as it can find them.


Worms on the other hand instead of infecting computer hard drives, it seeks out network addresses that it will go through. It will go through ports. Ways to protect from worm attacks is to implement a firewall.

RAT - remote access trojan. They look like normal remote desktop programs but for mallicious purposes, and it can silently install programs.

The difference between a RAT and a Bot is that a bot usually tends to be an IRC client, usually command line compared to a RAT that would have full view of the infected computer.

Trojan - software that you download that is usually free. Things that you cant really stop since you download it directly, as it goes through the web browser ports (port 80, and other ports). The firewall is happy for things to go through those ports.

uPnp (Unified Plug and Play), whitelists a port on the router that allows people to connect to it through that port.
