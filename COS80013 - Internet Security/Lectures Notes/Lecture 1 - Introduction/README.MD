## Terminology

This section contains a list of key terms and the meanings that will be used frequently in this subject.

- **Malware**

Malware is a general term that is used to describe types of intrusive software. Types of malware can include viruses, trojans, spyware and ransomware. It usually finds its way onto a computer or device without the users knowledge through scripts, links or even other programs.

**Types of Malware**
  
- Virus

Is a hostile software program designed to infect a host computer. The difference between a virus and a worm is that a virus is usually transmitted with human interaction, such as carrying it on a USB stick.

- Worm

Is a hostile software program designed to infect a host computer. The difference between a worm and a virus is that a worm does not require human intervention and can find itself onto a host computer through a network.

- Trojan

Is a program that mimics a well known or trusted program but performs a evil action. An installation prompt or login prompt can look all well and good but could secretly be a trojan that when used will deliver other malware.

- Spyware

Is a type of malware that collections and sends information about the user of a computer or the computer itself to its owner.

- Dialer

Is a type of malware that installs itself and attemps to dial international numbers meaning that the owner will be charged.

- Key Logger

Is hardware or software that records keystrokes, screen captures and sends it back to a remote monitor. This can be analysed to retrieve passwords and account information.

**Solution** - Installing antiviruses, anti-spyware, firewalls, restrict user access.

- **Online Threats**

When on Internet, threats can come from all areas. Hackers can install fake "updates" onto your machine that can contain mallicious code.

Servers can be targeted and taken offline (DOS) and information can be stolen off them (passwords, credit cards).

Corporate networks (LAN, WAN) can be broken into through backdoors (phishing, spear-phishing, corporate espionage).

**Solution** - DMZ, firewalls, UTM, IPS, policies and backups.

- **Offline Threats**

Comprise of threats that do not require connection to the Internet. These can come in forms of trojects or other mallicious software being carried on USB drives.

The mallicious software can contain key loggers, drive wiping programs or viruses.

**Solution** - Anti-virus software, do not allow drives to be plugged in.

- **Physical Threats**

Physical threats comprise people within an organisation that will do harm to a software system. These people can be planted in there or coerced into giving up sensitive information. 

**Social engineering** is a term that involves tricking people into breaking corporate procedures to provide information.

- **Fail Open Authorisation**

Is a situation when user authentication fails but the user is still allowed access to sections of a web application. Systems designed with fail=open authentication have allowd hackers to bypass authentication systems and enact DOS attacks on a website to crash it.

- **Hacker**

An expert computer user who is prepared to bypass the normal UI to customise, enhance, test and investigate software and hardware.

- **Cracker**

A hacker who uses his powers for evil.

- **Black Hat**

A cracker.

- **White Hat**

A hacker to discovers and documents security flaws for the greater good.

- **Grey Hat**

A white hat hacker who crosses the line for political, social or ethical reasons (i.e. Edward Snowden)

- **Script Kiddies/ Skiddies**

Amatuer crackers (black hat) who download and use security exploits for fun and profit.

- **Sneakers/Penetration Testers/Security Auditors**

A white hat hacker who is paid to test the security of a software system.

- **Exploit**

Code that can be used to comprise a software product or service. It can be something as simple as opening a port, installing and executing code.

- **Crack**

A modification to the installed software that will allow logins, registration, cd-key entry to be bypassed.

- **Script**

Code that is executed by another software system. Native code is considered as code executed by the hardware.

- **Bot or RAT**

A bot is a pre-programmed program that communicates with its leader (bot-hearder) through a network. It is capable of sending/receiving data between the infected machine and its home. A RAT is similar to a bot that allows for real-time interaction with the machine that the RAT resides on.

- **Root Kit Technology**

It overrides the root priveledges of the infected system and usually used to patch the host to allow malware to be installed without being detected as it is installed as a root priveledge.

- **Firewall**

Is a barrier between the device (PC, LAN, Phone) and an untrusted environment (Internet). It can be software or hardware that is dedicated to regulate and monitor network traffic. It can also open and block ports to ensure that messages only arrive on trusted ports.

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**

Is an application layer of a hardware device that can analyse the contents of a message (IP packet) to determine if an attack is occuring. This can act as a sort of firewall.

There are different types of IDS, and can also be known as a IPS (Intrustion Prevention System). These can be host (HIPS) and network (NIDS) based.

- **Appliance**

Is a purpose built piece of hardware that can act as a IDS or firwall.

- **NAT-Router**

A network router that can change the IP address of packets that are coming into a network. This can allow multiple PC's to share the same common IP address.

- **Proxy Server**

Is a server that uses NAT-Routing, caching and filtering services.
