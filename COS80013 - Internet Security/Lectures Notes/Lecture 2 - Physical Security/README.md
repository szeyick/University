## Terminology

The following contains a summarised version of terms used in the lecture.

- **Access Control Policy**

The term defines the access and management of keys. For example, who has access, how are they issued, lost, stolen and master keys.

- **Lock Picking**

Lock picking is a deterrent and not a way to control security. Locks can be picked in mayn different ways such as, key copying, brute force, bump keys and pick guns.

- **Side Channel Attack**

The idea here is to not touch the lock at all but to destroy or circumvent the area around it. For example, rather than picking the lock you could take the hinges off a door or kick it down. It achieves the same result without having to touch the lock.

- **Biometrics**

A form of security that uses a human characterstic as the key. It needs to adhere to certain properties that make it unique, permanent (doesnt change over time), hard to forge and is something that can be collected. 

Examples of this can be, signatures, iris and retina scanners and fingerprints.

- **Denial of Service (DOS) Attack**

Taking down a website or network that prevents user accessing the resource. Aside from launching a software based attack, physical threats such as fire and flood can also result in a DOS attack. During these types of incidents, emergency exits become entry points for attackers.

- **Eavesdropping**

Listening into communications, generally achieved through MITM attacks, phone logging, key logging and WiFi sniffing.

- **Physical Attacks**

Not all attacks on computers need to be through a network or software. There are plenty of ways to access a computer through physical means, with CD,s USBs, OS booting, RAM freezing.

- **Key Logging**

The process of logging keystrokes with or without a users knowledge. Key loggers can be both hardware and software based, where hardware key loggers are required to be physically installed. Software key loggers can be in a form of malware (spyware) that sends the logged keystrokes back to the attacker.

- **Card Skimmers**

Usually installed on ATM's to read information from a cards magnetic strip. Sometimes a keypad logger is also installed on the same device to also record the pin number.

- **Semi Air Gap Security**

A step down from full air gap security. In this instance, there is network based communication between computers. The network based communication is one way, meaning there are no return messges, handshakes or feedback. It is usually used to protect critical infrastructure such as dams and gas pipes.

- **Air Gap Failures**

Since communication is performed through carrying communications by physical means, these physical devices (CD's, USB's) can be compromised with malware. Once it is plugged into the system, it is free to infiltrate the systems.

- **Social Engineering**

Social engineering is the means of obtaining information without the use of a computer. These means include, social media, impersonating someone, accessing public surveillance cameras.

- **Rings of Security**

Installing multiple layers of security for an organisation to prevent dangerous things from the internet breaching an enterprise network. Firewalls, anti-virus, patches and physical locks.

- **Preventing Security Breaches**

Common sense approach to prevent security breach, SSL, HTTPS, SCP, don't talk about confidential information in public spaces.

- **Forensics**

Recovering information and evidence that can be used in court to charge someone with computer crimes.
