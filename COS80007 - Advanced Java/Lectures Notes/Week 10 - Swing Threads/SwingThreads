## Swing Threads

### Event Dispatch Thread

- Handles all the user events (ActionEvent, ChangeEvent, etc), including the Swing Timer events.

- It also calls paint(), paintComponent(), validate()

- It calls run() on the event queue by other threads.

- The event dispatch thread should not be used for long tasks since it will be unresponsive.

### Worker Threads

Additional threads can be introduced to run background tasks that can take a long time. This way we can avoid using the EventDispatchThread to do complex calculations.

We can still place something onto the event queue by calling **invokeLater** or **invokeAndWait**.

### Swing Worker

Provides a thread and machinery to interact with the AWT eent thread.

We can extend this class and override the methods -

- doInBackGround() - functions like run(), defines what to do.
- done() - invoked on the event queue when doInBackGround() is finished.
- process() - invoked on the event queue to receive data sent by publish().
- get() - meant to be called by AWT to retrieve results from doItBackGround().
